# Object-Pool-Pattern---Example-Unity3D

This repository is a Unity3D project, that shows an implementation about Object Pool Pattern using a generic Object Pool class, that only require prefabs. I publish this project because I want to share with you my way to implement this important pattern for games that require a high level performance.

For more information about the project, please visit the link below.
